Usage
-----------------------------------------------------
All scripts are in 'Code 2' folder so switch to that directory

To find out rating of a movie for a user whose only the demographic information is known run this command:
        demo(age,gender,occupation,zipcode,movie_name,K_for_k-NN)
        demo(21,'M','student','94043','Niagara, Niagara ',5)

To run the whole code and compute everything for yourself open script.m and edit the dataset names in the following two lines:
        dataset=read_dataset('../ml-100k/u3.base',0);
        testset=read_dataset('../ml-100k/u3.test',0);
Now run this command:
        script
